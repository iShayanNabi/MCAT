The number of hours required to complete this MCAT study plan will vary depending on several factors, including your prior knowledge, learning pace, study efficiency, and the depth of understanding you want to achieve. However, as a rough estimate, let's break down the approximate time commitment:

**Month 1: Building Foundations**
- Assuming 4 hours of study per day, 5 days a week, this would be around 80 hours.

**Month 2: Deepening the Knowledge**
- Similarly, 4 hours of study per day, 5 days a week, would be another 80 hours.

**Month 3: Psychology and Sociology Introduction**
- Again, 4 hours of study per day, 5 days a week, amounts to approximately 80 hours.

**Month 4: Practice and Integration**
- As you are combining practice with content review, let's estimate 5 hours of study per day, 5 days a week, totaling around 100 hours.

**Month 5: Full-Length Practice and Review**
- With more emphasis on practice and review, let's assume 6 hours of study per day, 5 days a week, equaling about 120 hours.

**Month 6: Final Review and Fine-Tuning**
- In the final month, let's consider 6 hours of study per day, 5 days a week, totaling around 120 hours.

Adding up the estimates for each month:

Month 1: 80 hours
Month 2: 80 hours
Month 3: 80 hours
Month 4: 100 hours
Month 5: 120 hours
Month 6: 120 hours

Total: Approximately 580 hours
